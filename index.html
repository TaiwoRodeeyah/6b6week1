            <h2>Carbohydrate</h2>
            
                <p>Carbohydrates are essential food nutrients that your body turns into glucose to give you the energy to function.
                    Complex carbs in fruits, vegetables and whole-grain products are less likely to spike blood sugar than simple carbs (sugars).
                    Low-carb diets like keto can be high in fats</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates can form part of a healthful diet.However, eating too many carbohydrates or choosing the wrong type can lead to weight gain or other health issues.</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates are divided into four types: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides consist of a simple sugar; that is, they have the chemical formula C6H12O6. Disaccharides are two simple sugars. Oligosaccharides are three to six monosaccharide units, and polysaccharides are more than six.</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates are probably the most abundant and widespread organic substances in nature, and they are essential constituents of all living things.</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates are formed by green plants from carbon dioxide and water during the process of photosynthesis. </p>
                <p>Carbohydrates serve as energy sources and as essential structural components in organisms; in addition, part of the structure of nucleic acids, which contain genetic information, consists of carbohydrate.</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates are mainly found in plant foods. They also occur in dairy products in the form of a milk sugar called lactose. Foods high in carbohydrates include bread, pasta, beans, potatoes, rice, and cereals.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Bread</li>
                        <li>Milk</li>
                        <li>Rice</li>
                        <li>Potato</li>
                        <li>Spagetti</li>
                    </ul>
                
            
            <h2>Fats and oil</h2>
            
                <p>Fats and oils are made up of molecules known as triglycerides, which are esters consisting of three fatty acid units connected to glycerol.
                     The rise in the amount of shorter chain fatty acids and/or unsaturated fatty acids reduces the melting point for fat or oil.</p>
                    <p>Fats and oil provide energy for living organisms, insulate body organs, and transport fat-soluble </p>
                    <p>Fats and oils contribute to an important part of our diet. They are a source of essential fatty acids and a concentrated source of energy in terms of human nutrition.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, fats and oils can also provide distinctive flavours to food and provide unique and desirable functions during cooking. </p>
                    <p> For example, oils are the frying media for deep fried food; and when making pastries, fats (shortenings) are added to prevent the flour and other ingredients from clumping together.</p>
                    <p>Some people think that fats and oils are different things. But in reality, they share a common chemical structure and similar properties.</p>
                    <p>The difference is that those that stay solid at room temperatures are called fats while those that stay liquid at room temperatures are called oils. Chemically, each fat or oil molecule consists of three long strings of fatty acid molecules combined with a glycerol molecule. Fats and oils may originate from plants, land or marine animals. Fats and oils may contain small amounts of other minor components that are naturally present. As fats and oils are produced by organisms as a way to store energy, they are found in a wide range of plants and animals.</p>

                    <li>Coconut oil</li>
                    <li>Cod liver oil</li>
                   </ol>
                
            
        <h2>Fibre</h2>
            
                <p>Fibre is made up of the indigestible parts or compounds of plants, which pass relatively unchanged through our stomach and intestines.</p>
                    <p>Fibre helps regulate the body's use of sugar in check. Children and adults need atleast 25 to 35 grams of fibre per day for good health.</p>
                    <p>Fibre is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot break down and so it passes through our gut into our large intestine (or colon). It is found naturally in plant foods like wholegrains, beans, nuts, fruit and vegetables and is sometimes added to foods or drinks.</p>
                    <p>It helps to keep our digestive system healthy and helps to prevent constipation. A high fibre diet may help to reduce our risk of heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal (bowel) cancer.</p>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of fibre, and they have different effects on our body. Some types influence how quickly food moves through our gut, adding bulk to stools and <q>keeping you regular</q>, some can impact our blood cholesterol and how quickly we absorb sugar from foods and drinks, and some can influence the types and amounts of bacteria in our gut.</p>
                    <p>Research shows that the bacteria and other micro-organisms in our gut may be important for health, although there is still a lot we do not know. Fibre found in foods like wheat, oats, beans, pulses, fruit and vegetables such as garlic and onions provide <q>food</q> for <q>good</q> gut bacteria, allowing them to grow in number and produce substances that are thought to have beneficial effects on health.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that adults get 30g of fibre a day, but, on average, we eat much less than this about 20g a day. Many children over the age of 2 years also need to increase the amount of fibre in their diet, although their recommended intakes are lower than for adults.</p>
